# Quality gates

## Pull requests

The `quality` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests and pushes
to `main`. It installs locked dependencies and Chromium, then runs `pnpm check`:
formatting, lint, strict types, unit tests, production build and browser tests.
The workflow has read-only permissions, no deployment, no secrets, no retained
checkout credentials and no artifact uploads. Actions use fixed commit SHAs.
Redundant runs for the same ref are cancelled.

The independent `.github/workflows/pages.yml` workflow deploys only pushes to
`main` (or an explicit manual dispatch). It builds Next.js Static Export with
the `/Celenas-SMP` Project Site base path, verifies `out/`, then uploads and
deploys that artifact. It does not run for pull requests and does not change the
normal `pnpm check` workflow.

Use the same Node.js major, pnpm version and commands locally. CI uses Ubuntu;
Windows development is also supported. Configure branch protection to require
`quality` separately when repository policy is decided. A workflow alone does
not configure protection.

## Before handoff

1. Install with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; ensure peer checks pass.
2. Run `pnpm check` and inspect the actual output.
3. Review the diff, tracked files and Git state. Exclude generated output,
   credentials, private data, logs and machine-specific paths.
4. Check desktop/narrow rendering, keyboard focus and reduced motion.
5. Check docs match implementation; disclose missing product data or branding.
6. Inspect CI for the exact PR commit. Report pending, failed or unavailable
   checks honestly. Never merge without explicit authorization.

## Before public release

Confirm server details, community links, official logo, imagery rights, content
and domain. Review dependency advisories and the documented lint compatibility
exception. Choose hosting and its security/privacy policy. Add browser coverage
and manual assistive-technology testing proportionate to the audience. Phase 1
does not authorize deployment or server polling.

Passing CI establishes a development foundation, not a finished public site.
