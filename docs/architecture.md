# Frontend architecture

## Boundaries

Celenas Web Phase 1 is a static landing page rendered by Next.js App Router.
It has no API routes, data collection, authentication, external runtime requests
or client state. Internal anchors provide navigation without a custom library.

| Location                               | Responsibility                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/app/layout.tsx`                   | Japanese language, metadata, global styles           |
| `src/app/page.tsx`                     | Semantic home-page composition                       |
| `src/components/community-details.tsx` | Configured / unavailable participation details       |
| `src/config/site.ts`                   | Reviewed, public product configuration               |
| `src/styles/tokens.css`                | Shared visual tokens                                 |
| `tests/`                               | Component behavior in jsdom                          |
| `e2e/`                                 | Production page in Playwright                        |
| `scripts/next.mjs`                     | Portable Next.js entry point with telemetry disabled |

Server components are the default. Add a client boundary only for an implemented
interaction needing browser state or APIs. Do not introduce state stores,
animation engines, 3D libraries or data-query clients speculatively.

## Public configuration

`site.connection` holds the server address, Minecraft version and Discord URL.
Unknown values are `null`; the page displays an honest unavailable state and
does not create dead links. Update only with confirmed public values, then
rebuild. No environment file or secret is necessary.

The configuration is trusted, reviewed source code, not a user input boundary.
`CommunityConnection` requires an HTTPS URL at compile time. If a CMS, API or
user input later feeds these values, add runtime validation at that boundary.
Do not put private service addresses or credentials in this public object.

## Dependencies and runtime

Use Node.js 24 and the package-manager version in `package.json`. Dependencies
are pinned and the pnpm lockfile is committed. The installed pnpm 11.25.0 is
retained for local/CI parity. Its one-day release-age protection is explicit;
do not bypass it casually to obtain a just-published version.

Next.js and React use compatible stable releases. ESLint 9 and TypeScript 6.0
are compatibility exceptions: the installed Next.js lint plugins do not yet
declare support for ESLint 10 or TypeScript 7. ESLint 9 is upstream-deprecated;
revisit this pin when the plugins support the maintained major. Never silence
peer errors to force an upgrade. `strictPeerDependencies` makes mismatches fail.

Only the native resolver's required install hook is allowed. Script commands do
not auto-install dependencies (`verifyDepsBeforeRun: false`); run an explicit
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` first. Dependencies and browser installation need
network access; the product does not use remote services.

Plain CSS serves the small initial UI. Tailwind may be added when it improves
implemented work. System fonts avoid build-time font downloads.

## Deferred decisions

Phase 2 owns the full information architecture, canonical logo, approved
Minecraft imagery, Liquid Glass interactions and new content routes. Hosting,
domain, server integration and production policy remain undecided.
