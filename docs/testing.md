# Testing

## Setup and commands

Use Node.js 24 and pnpm 11.25.0. Install with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
Install Chromium once with `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` (Linux CI uses
`--with-deps`). If a Windows shell cannot resolve the pnpm-exec shim, use
`.\node_modules\.bin\playwright.cmd install chromium`.

| Command             | Evidence                                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm format:check` | Formatting consistency                                   |
| `pnpm lint`         | Next.js, React and TypeScript lint; warnings fail        |
| `pnpm typecheck`    | Next route types and strict TypeScript, including tests  |
| `pnpm test`         | Component behavior with Vitest and React Testing Library |
| `pnpm test:watch`   | Focused local feedback                                   |
| `pnpm build`        | Production compilation and static generation             |
| `pnpm test:e2e`     | Fresh production server, desktop/mobile Chromium         |
| `pnpm check`        | All gates, ending in production browser checks           |
| `pnpm verify:pages` | Verify the Pages static export after its build           |

Run `pnpm build` before standalone `pnpm test:e2e`; `pnpm check` does this for
you. Playwright starts its own server on loopback port 3100 and refuses to reuse
an existing listener. Free that port instead of changing reuse behavior.

## Coverage

Component tests verify unavailable information has no fabricated join action and
configured values produce readable details and a usable HTTPS link. Fixtures
use reserved `.test` domains; those are never production defaults. Lunar phase
unit tests use fixed UTC dates and verify phase sectors, waxing/waning,
illumination bounds and deterministic output. Visual component tests check
decorative SVG output and phase-driven atmospheric CSS properties.

Browser tests load the production page, follow the participation anchor, check
missing information, the canonical logo and site icon, pending gallery state,
the date-driven decorative lunar SVG, CSS motion, keyboard-operable mobile menu
navigation and close-on-selection, destination focus, keyboard skip navigation,
runtime errors, layout overflow from 320px through wide desktop at 200% text
scaling, reduced motion and axe WCAG A/AA rules. Desktop and mobile projects
both use Chromium; this is not Safari or Firefox coverage.

To validate the GitHub Pages output locally on PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:GITHUB_PAGES = "true"
$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH = "/Celenas-SMP"
pnpm build
pnpm verify:pages
Remove-Item Env:GITHUB_PAGES
Remove-Item Env:NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH
```

The Pages verifier checks `out/index.html`, the project-prefixed Next.js
assets, the canonical logo, the exported icon, and that referenced local assets
exist. The deployment workflow runs it before uploading `out/`.

Prefer role/name queries and visible outcomes over implementation details or
broad snapshots. Test public behavior at the smallest useful layer. Use browser
tests for App Router integration and asynchronous server components.

## Privacy and limits

Traces, screenshots, video and remote artifact upload are off by default. Capture
synthetic/local content intentionally when diagnosing a defect. Generated test
metadata stays ignored. Never capture real player/server data or secrets.

Manual visual, keyboard, screen-reader and eventual cross-browser checks
complement automation. An axe pass is not a certification. On failure, identify
the cause, fix the relevant layer and rerun the affected check. Avoid blind retries.
